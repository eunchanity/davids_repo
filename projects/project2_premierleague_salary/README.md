Predicting Premier League Players' Salaries with Linear Regression
==============================

## Project 2 at [Metis](www.thisismetis.com)
**Objective**: Build a linear regression model to predict Premier League players' salaries using quantitative player statistics.

**Tools**:
- Gather data by web scraping players' statistics
- Select a model through cross-validation
- Optimize features and hyper-parameters through ridge regression and additional model tuning

### Setup

#### 1) Access **project2_premleague_salary_stats.ipynb** in the notebooks folder to follow the web scraping
* *Please note*, the exported file (premleague_salary_stats.csv) was unable to scrape every available player salary due to time contraints. Thus, some available salaries were manually entered and are available in premleague_salary_stats_edited.csv. This edited csv is the one that is used for linear regression modeling.
* The exported csv files are available in the notebook_exports folder:
<pre><code>https://github.com/eunchanity/davids_repo/tree/master/projects/project2_premierleague_salary/notebooks/notebook_exports</code></pre>


#### 2) Access **project2_premleague_salary_linreg.ipynb** in the notebooks folder to follow the linear regression modeling
* Model selection through cross-validation
* Model tuning through feature selection, hyper-parameter optimization, and log transformation
* Model testing
* Interpretation of results

#### 3) Access **project2_premleague_salary.pdf** in the reports folder to follow the presentation deck
* Presentation of model creation and model outputs
* Implications of the model's results
* Additional considerations
* The presentation can also be followed in my blog:
